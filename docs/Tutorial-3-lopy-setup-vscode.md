Pycom supports Microsoftâ€™s Visual Studio Code IDE platform with the Pymakr Plugin.

1. First download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. You will also need NodeJS installed on your PC. Please download the latest LTS version available [from the NodeJS website](https://nodejs.org/).

Please follow these steps to install [the Pymakr VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pycom.Pymakr):

3. Ensure that you have the latest VSCode installed and open.

4. Navigate to the Extensions page, using the 5th button in the left navigation.

5. Search for Pymakr and click the install button next to it.

6. Within a few minutes, a reload button should appear. Press it to reload VSCode.

7. Clone and open the project from [this](https://github.com/saguilarDevel/schc-sigfox) repository.

8. Prepare the LoPy for connection to the computer.
